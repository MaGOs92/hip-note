#### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build


# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
npm run lint

# Publish new release
## Draft a new release. Set the “Tag version” to the value of version in your application package.json, and prefix it with v. “Release title” can be anything you want.
## For example, if your application package.json version is 1.0, your draft’s “Tag version” would be v1.0.
## Push some commits. Every CI build will update the artifacts attached to this draft.
### Once you are done, publish the release. GitHub will tag the latest commit for you
npm run build:publish

```
